# Branch: Validation

For the Validation phase we have an Apache Webserver configured on Node 1 that can generate a required number of logs.

To be able to analyse data sent to the blockchain some changes need to be made to the chaincode, data structure, and middleware Java application.

update logic.js

update org1.andrew.lognetwork.cto

Or simply replace the BNA file already generated.

Change Fabric logging levels from DEBUG to INFO.

An additional TPS test function is included in the middleware Java application.
