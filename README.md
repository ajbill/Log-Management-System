# Branch: Validation

For the Validation phase we have an Apache Webserver configured on Node 1 that can generate a required number of logs.

To be able to analyse data to sent to the blockchain we shall make some alterations to the chaincode and data structure.

Please see the updates to:

org1.andrew.lognetwork.cto

logic.js

Make sure to replace the BNA directory in /log/????????? Withe the one here so that the correct files are loaded when staring Composer.
